Detailed Tutorial: 
------------------
Hello, if you are here to gain members/raid servers/make verified tokens for any reason, then this tutorial will help you, alright, first of all, you will need any browser that has a built in vpn, theres many browsers that has vpns, you can also use vpns that are outside of the browser but i suggest using a browser that has vpns ( not only one vpn, atleast 3), so once you have your vpns ready, go into incognito mode/private browsing in the browser, then go to (https://discord.com/register), once you're there, go ahead and make a new gmail account, you can also use your own gmail, when you have your gmail account ready, you can go ahead and make a new account, for the email section put your email then add a + sign and any number, like this:
youremail+1@gmail.com
youremail+2@gmail.com
youremail+3@gmail.com
youremail+4@gmail.com
youremail+5@gmail.com
youremail+6@gmail.com
and before you finish clicking the register button, right click anywhere on the discord tab, then click on application then local storage then https://discord.com, and then you can input whatever type of info on everything except for the email which will be the email you created and after it + and any random number, then click on register, when your register is done, you will see something named token in the applications tab

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
you can go ahead and click on token, then copy the token like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
but remove the ("")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
all of the verifications will come to the email that you made, so you can make infinite accounts with this method, just change the numbers, and between each account you want to make, you need to change your vpn to another country, and then make the account, because if you try to do this on only 1 vpn you will get rate limited, so just keep on switching between vpns and change the numbers after the +
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
once you have all of your tokens ready, you can go ahead and download the rtb (raid tool box that can use the tokens that you make to raid servers/or join servers)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
link for the rtb ( with source if you think its a virus ) : https://mega.nz/file/ZzIwnRgS#LhFW5xTWfn0bpJ8oNy4uJa9Z-kMIwnET6wkejaUp5_Y
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
before downloading the rtb, you need an app that can extract .zip files, i suggest using https://winrar.com
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
once you have downloaded winrar, you can go ahead and download the rtb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when you download the rtb, you can just go ahead and extract the (Discord Haxx Linktree(__1).zip)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
when you extract it you are going to see a file named ( OpenDiscordHaxx-master ), click on it, then go to (OpenDiscordHaxx), then click on (bin), then click on (Debug), then make a new text file thats named (Tokens), in that file, insert/paste all the tokens that you want to raid servers with/make them join your server or any server you want them to join, after doing that, run the OpenDHBackend.exe,  after doing that you can go back to the file directory you were first in (OpenDiscordHaxx-master), and then click on (OpenDiscordHaxxUI), then you are going to find a file called (Index.html) or just (Index), after finding the file, right click on it and then, go to open with, and open with chrome, now you are done, you will see everything you need there, it explains everything there so i dont need to continue :)
